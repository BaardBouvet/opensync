## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-06

First public release. The browser playground is live on GitHub Pages — no install, no
server, just a URL. The sync engine is pre-release; APIs and config shapes may still change.

OpenSync is a hub-and-spoke bi-directional sync engine. Data flows through a central shadow
state (SQLite), never directly between systems. This release ships:

- **Browser playground** — runs the full sync engine in the browser via WebAssembly SQLite.
  Visualises identity clusters across all connected systems, lets you edit records and channel
  config live, and shows the sync event log with before/after diffs. Three built-in scenarios
  (`two-system`, `three-system`, `associations-demo`).

- **Sync engine** (`@opensync/engine`) — bi-directional sync with canonical identity map,
  field mapping, echo detection, noop suppression, circuit breakers, OAuth2/API-key auth,
  eager association dispatch with deferred retry, and 412 ETag retry.

- **Connector SDK** (`@opensync/sdk`) — typed interface for building connectors (read, write,
  discover, webhook hooks). Reference connectors: HubSpot, Kafka, PostgreSQL, SPARQL,
  Tripletex, WaveApps.

- **Release infrastructure** — tag-triggered GitHub Actions (`release.yml`,
  `deploy-playground.yml`); pushes to `main` do not rebuild the live site.
